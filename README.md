# Boston House Price Prediction

This small case study is based on the dataset present in Sklearn.datasets . In this I have implemented basic ML techniques and deployed the model in Heroku Platform using Flask. 
I have applied Linear Regression , Lasso ,Ridge , KNNRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGRegressor techniques using RandomisedCV Technique to get most efficient model. I got best R2 score with least rmse for XGRegressor ,so will be using that as the final model for the deployment.
